# Music Royalty NFTs

A blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes music industry royalty distribution through NFTs, enabling transparent, automated, and fair compensation for artists, producers, and stakeholders.

## Project Description

Music Royalty NFTs is a smart contract system built on the Core Testnet 2 blockchain that tokenizes music tracks as NFTs and automates royalty distribution to multiple stakeholders. The platform allows music creators to mint NFTs representing their tracks, set royalty percentages, and automatically distribute earnings to various parties involved in the music creation process.

The system eliminates traditional intermediaries, reduces payment delays, and provides complete transparency in royalty distribution. Each music track NFT contains metadata about the song, artist information, and configurable royalty sharing mechanisms that can be updated as needed.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized ecosystem where:

- **Artists maintain full control** over their intellectual property and revenue streams
- **Transparency** is built into every transaction and royalty distribution
- **Instant payments** replace traditional delayed royalty systems
- **Global accessibility** allows artists worldwide to monetize their work
- **Fair distribution** ensures all contributors receive their rightful share
- **Reduced costs** eliminate unnecessary intermediaries and fees

We aim to democratize the music industry by providing tools that empower independent artists while offering major labels and producers a more efficient way to manage royalties.
